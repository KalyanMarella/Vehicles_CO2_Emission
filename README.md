## Vehicles CO2 Emissions Prediction
The Vehicles CO2 Emission Prediction project leverages advanced machine learning and MLOps practices to predict vehicle CO2 emissions based on key vehicle attributes such as engine size, fuel type, and more.

This system uses ZenML to build reproducible and automated ML pipelines, facilitating efficient model training, evaluation, and deployment. MLflow helps track experiments, manage model versions, and ensure transparency in model performance.

The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly platform for real-time predictions, while model and data drift monitoring ensures long-term accuracy and continuous model improvement.

#### Why These Technologies?
- ZenML allows for streamlined automation of the entire ML lifecycle, enhancing reproducibility and scalability.
- MLflow enables robust model tracking and management, ensuring the model remains relevant over time.
- Streamlit creates a seamless user experience for vehicle CO2 emission predictions, making it easy for anyone to interact with the model.
