## Vehicles CO2 Emissions Predict
The Vehicles CO2 Emission Prediction project combines advanced machine learning with MLOps practices to predict the CO2 emissions of vehicles. Using ZenML for creating robust, reproducible pipelines, the system automates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. MLflow is utilized to track experiments and manage models, enabling seamless model versioning and monitoring. The application includes a Streamlit interface, allowing real-time user input and predictions. Additionally, the system incorporates model and data drift monitoring, ensuring long-term accuracy and efficient deployment for sustainable model performance.
